blazy is a minimal, composablr, end to end typesafe, backend oriented web framework.

# Minimal
we do not wanna do much, our aim is simple

# Typesafe
we have tried to make the framework as type safe as possible. 

## Why is typesafety important

### Less mental bandwith

We as humans cant have as much context in our minds as a compilwr can so tje more context we can pffset to the compiler to remember the better for us. Also if there is a task rhat a compiler cpuld handle its probably not one which requires that much critical thinking, so by outsourcing these mundane checks to the compiler we can allocatw more of our focus to things that actually need critical thinking

### Less code

The more type infetence we have the less of a need for manual types which reduces the code we need to write significantly which in most cases is a gpod thing and when its not we can always supply a type manually

### Better agentic support

if you have ever used an llm fpr coding you will know that typed languages are vastly superior in this regard. so by making it as typeaafe as possible we can utilize the most from agentic tools

### More compile time checks

whenever we shpuld decide whether somwthing is checked at runtime or compile time we shoild opt for compile time. The compiler checks everything everytime, the runtime is a ticking time bomb
